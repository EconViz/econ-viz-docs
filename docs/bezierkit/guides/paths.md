# Cubic segments and paths

<span id="sec-paths"></span>

Renderers draw cubics: TikZ's `.. controls ..`, SVG's `C` and Matplotlib's
`CURVE4` all take four control points. `CubicBezierSegment` is that cubic as
a value object, and `PiecewiseBezier` joins cubics into paths.

## Cubic segments

<!-- api: agora.bezierkit.guides_paths_1 -->

An immutable cubic with its four control points as the fields `p0`, `p1`,
`p2`, `p3` (also `control_points`, and iteration). It evaluates,
differentiates, splits, restricts and reverses like a `BezierCurve`, but
`split()`, `segment()` and `reversed()` return cubic segments again.
`segment(t, t)` returns the degenerate cubic whose four controls are all
$B(t)$.

## Tight bounding boxes

<span id="def-bbox"></span>

!!! abstract "Definition · Axis-aligned bounding box"

    The axis-aligned bounding box of a non-empty bounded set $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is
    the smallest box

    $$
    [\alpha_1, \beta_1] \times \ldots \times [\alpha_d, \beta_d]
    $$

    that contains $K$, where $\alpha_k = \inf \lbrace x_k : x \in K\rbrace$ and
    $\beta_k = \sup \lbrace x_k : x \in K\rbrace$.

The convex hull of the control points contains a curve ([Convex hull](curves.md#cor-hull)) but can be
far larger than it. `bounding_box` returns the box of [Axis-aligned bounding box](paths.md#def-bbox) for the
curve itself ([The tight bounding box of a cubic.](paths.md#fig-bbox)). Its candidates come from the roots of the
derivative of each coordinate.

<span id="prop-bbox"></span>

!!! abstract "Proposition · Bounding box of a cubic"

    Let $B$ be the cubic with control points $P_0, \ldots, P_3 \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and put

    $$
    a = -P_0 + 3P_1 - 3P_2 + P_3, \quad b = 3P_0 - 6P_1 + 3P_2, \quad c = 3(P_1 - P_0).
    $$

    Then $B(t) = a t^3 + b t^2 + c t + P_0$. For each coordinate $k$ let $T_k$
    consist of $0$, $1$ and the roots in $(0, 1)$ of

    $$
    B'_k (t) = 3a_k t^2 + 2 b_k t + c_k
    $$

    when this polynomial is not identically zero; when it is, $T_k = \lbrace 0, 1\rbrace$.
    Then the coordinates of the bounding box of $B([0, 1])$ are

    $$
    \alpha_k = \min_{t \in T_k} B_k (t), \quad \beta_k = \max_{t \in T_k} B_k (t).
    $$

<!-- api: agora.bezierkit.guides_paths_2 -->

`(low, high)`: two points holding the per-axis minimum and maximum of the
curve, found by evaluating it at the candidate parameters of [Bounding box of a cubic](paths.md#prop-bbox).

## Degree elevation

Degree elevation ([Degree elevation](curves.md#prop-raise-degree)) writes a curve of degree $n$ as a curve
of degree $n + 1$ with the same parameterization. The package needs it to
write lines and quadratics as cubics, so that every renderer receives four
control points. Applying [Degree elevation](curves.md#prop-raise-degree) once or twice gives the controls
below.

<span id="prop-elevation"></span>

!!! abstract "Proposition · Lines and quadratics as cubics"

    The line from $P_0$ to $P_3$, parameterized by $(1 - t) P_0 + t P_3$, is the
    cubic with controls

    $$
    P_0, \quad P_0 + 1/3 (P_3 - P_0), \quad P_0 + 2/3 (P_3 - P_0), \quad P_3.
    $$

    The quadratic with controls $P_0, C, P_3$ is the cubic with controls

    $$
    P_0, \quad P_0 + 2/3 (C - P_0), \quad P_3 + 2/3 (C - P_3), \quad P_3.
    $$

    In both cases the curve and its parameterization are unchanged.

<!-- api: agora.bezierkit.guides_paths_3 -->

In `bezierkit.bezier`. Turns a linear, quadratic or cubic `BezierCurve`
into a `CubicBezierSegment` by [Lines and quadratics as cubics](paths.md#prop-elevation) (a segment is returned as
is); higher degrees raise `DegreeError`.

<!-- api: agora.bezierkit.guides_paths_4 -->

The cubic of the line from `p0` to `p3`.

<!-- api: agora.bezierkit.guides_paths_5 -->

The cubic of the quadratic with the given controls.

```python
from bezierkit.bezier import to_cubic

q = BezierCurve.quadratic(Point(0, 0), Point(3, 6), Point(9, 0))
print(to_cubic(q).control_points)
# (Point(coords=(0.0, 0.0)), Point(coords=(2.0, 4.0)),
#  Point(coords=(5.0, 4.0)), Point(coords=(9.0, 0.0)))
```

## Piecewise paths

<!-- api: agora.bezierkit.guides_paths_6 -->

A path of cubic segments. Consecutive segments must meet: each segment's
`p3` must lie within `continuity_tolerance` of the next one's `p0`, and a
closed path's last `p3` within it of the first `p0`; otherwise
`ValueError` is raised. `closed` is metadata for exporters (SVG `Z`, TikZ
`cycle`): it never adds a closing segment.

The package parameterizes a path uniformly. This is a convention of
the package, not a standard notion: a path of $m$ segments
$S_0, \ldots, S_{m-1}$ is the map

$$
P(t) = S_k (m t - k), \quad k = \min(\left\lfloor m t \right\rfloor, m - 1), \quad t \in [0, 1].
$$

Each segment takes an equal share $1 / m$ of $[0, 1]$, regardless of its
length.

```python
from bezierkit import CubicBezierSegment, PiecewiseBezier

path = PiecewiseBezier(
    [
        CubicBezierSegment.from_line(Point(0, 0), Point(2, 0)),
        CubicBezierSegment.from_line(Point(2, 0), Point(2, 4)),
    ]
)
# Point(coords=(2.0, 2.0))
print(path.at(0.75))
# Point(coords=(2.0, 2.0))
print(path.segment(0.25, 0.75).at(1.0))
```

`compound()` gathers several paths into one, keeping their subpaths
separate, as for a shape with a hole. A compound path has no single
parameterization: evaluating, splitting or restricting it raises
`ValueError`; reversal and export work. Splitting or restricting a closed
path also raises, except for the whole path or a single point, since a
closed path has no first and last point to keep.

## Continuity

Two curves meet at a join. Let $h_S, h_T > 0$, let
$S : [u_0 - h_S, u_0] \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and $T : [u_0, u_0 + h_T] \to \mathbb{R}^d$ be
continuously differentiable as often as needed (with one-sided derivatives
at the ends of their intervals), and let $C$ be the curve that equals $S$ on
the first interval and $T$ on the second.

<span id="def-continuity"></span>

!!! abstract "Definition · Parametric continuity"

    For $k \ge 0$, the curve $C$ is $C^k$ at $u_0$ if
    $S^{(j)}(u_0) = T^{(j)}(u_0)$ for $j = 0, \ldots, k$.

<span id="def-geometric-continuity"></span>

!!! abstract "Definition · Geometric continuity $G^1$"

    The curve $C$ is $G^1$ at $u_0$ if $S(u_0) = T(u_0)$, the tangent vectors
    $S'(u_0)$ and $T'(u_0)$ are non-zero, and $T'(u_0) = \lambda S'(u_0)$ for
    some $\lambda > 0$; that is, the two unit tangents agree.

Parametric and geometric continuity are the standard notions for joined
curves [Farin (2002)](../project/references.md#farin2002)[Prautzsch (2002)](../project/references.md#prautzsch2002); the geometric notion of
every order $k$ is treated by [Barsky (1989)](../project/references.md#barsky1989). This manual uses $C^0$,
$C^1$ and $G^1$ only. A $C^1$ join with non-zero tangents is $G^1$.

<span id="prop-continuity"></span>

!!! abstract "Proposition · Continuity of cubic joins"

    Let $S$ and $T$ be the cubics with controls $P_0, \ldots, P_3$ and
    $Q_0, \ldots, Q_3$, evaluated at $(u - u_0 + h_S) / h_S$ and
    $(u - u_0) / h_T$ respectively.
    + $C$ is $C^0$ at $u_0$ if and only if $P_3 = Q_0$.
    + If $P_3 = Q_0$, then $C$ is $C^1$ at $u_0$ if and only if

    $$
    (P_3 - P_2) / h_S = (Q_1 - Q_0) / h_T.
    $$

    + If $P_3 = Q_0$, $P_3 \ne P_2$ and $Q_1 \ne Q_0$, then $C$ is $G^1$ at $u_0$
      if and only if $Q_1 - Q_0 = \mu (P_3 - P_2)$ for some $\mu > 0$.
    + Under the uniform parameterization of `PiecewiseBezier`, $h_S = h_T$, so
      the condition in 2 reads $P_3 - P_2 = Q_1 - Q_0$.

`PiecewiseBezier` enforces only $C^0$, a shared endpoint. Whether a join
should also be smooth is the caller's decision: a kink in an indifference
curve or a corner in a polyline is meant to stay.
